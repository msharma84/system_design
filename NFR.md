# Essential non-functional requirements in System Design

When designing scalable software systems, it’s easy to focus only on the core features, like data flow, architecture, databases, and APIs. But in real-world production systems, 
it’s often the non-functional requirements in system design that make or break your design.

## What are non-functional requirements?

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are the qualities and constraints that define a system’s behavior beyond its specific functions. While functional requirements describe what the system
should do (e.g., store user data, process orders), non-functional requirements describe how well it should do it.

These include areas like:

** Performance
** Scalability
** Availability
** Reliability
** Security
** Maintainability
** Observability

Ignoring non-functional requirements for system design considerations is a red flag. Engineers who focus only on data models and APIs but overlook scalability or fault tolerance
often miss what makes systems work at scale.
