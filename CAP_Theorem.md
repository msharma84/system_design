# CAP Theorem

The CAP theorem in system design states that a distributed data store can only guarantee two out of three desirable properties: **Consistency**, **Availability**, and **Partition Tolerance**. These properties are crucial considerations when designing systems that store data across multiple machines.

## Understanding the Properties:

**Consistency (C)**: Every read operation receives the most recent write or an error. This means all nodes in the system return the same data at the same time.

**Availability (A)**: Every request receives a response, even if it's not the most recent data. This means that the system remains operational and responsive, even if the response from some of the nodes donâ€™t reflect most up-to-date data.

**Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues to operate despite network failures or partitions, where nodes can't communicate with each other. Partition Tolerance is essential for distributed systems because network failures can and do happen. A system that tolerates partitions can maintain operations across different network segments.

## The CAP Trade-Off: Choosing 2 out of 3

The CAP theorem asserts that in the presence of a network partition, a distributed system must choose between Consistency and Availability.

Let's explore these scenarios:

### CP (Consistency and Partition Tolerance):

These systems prioritize consistency and can tolerate network partitions, but at the cost of availability. During a partition, the system may reject some requests to maintain consistency. Traditional relational databases, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, when configured for strong consistency, prioritize consistency over availability during network partitions. Banking systems typically prioritize consistency over availability since data accuracy is more critical than availability during network issues.

### AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance):

These systems ensure availability and can tolerate network partitions, but at the cost of consistency. During a partition, different nodes may return different values for the same data. NoSQL databases like Cassandra and DynamoDB are designed to be highly available and partition-tolerant, potentially at the cost of strong consistency. Amazon's shopping cart system is designed to always accept items, prioritizing availability.

### CA (Consistency and Availability):

In the absence of partitions, a system can be both consistent and available. However, network partitions are inevitable in distributed systems, making this combination impractical. Single-node databases can provide both consistency and availability but aren't partition-tolerant. In a distributed setting, this combination is theoretically impossible.

## Practical Design Strategies

Designing distributed systems requires carefully balancing these trade-offs based on application requirements. 

### Eventual Consistency

For many systems, strict consistency isn't always necessary. Eventual consistency can provide a good balance where updates are propagated to all nodes eventually, but not immediately. Systems where immediate consistency is not critical, such as DNS and content delivery networks (CDNs).

### Strong Consistency

A model ensuring that once a write is confirmed, any subsequent reads will return that value. Systems requiring high data accuracy, like financial applications and inventory management.

### Tunable Consistency

Tunable consistency allows systems to adjust their consistency levels based on specific needs, providing a balance between strong and eventual consistency. Systems like Cassandra allow configuring the level of consistency on a per-query basis, providing flexibility. Applications needing different consistency levels for different operations, such as e-commerce platforms where order processing requires strong consistency but product recommendations can tolerate eventual consistency.

### Quorum-Based Approaches:

Quorum-based approaches use voting among a group of nodes to ensure a certain level of consistency and fault tolerance. Systems needing a balance between consistency and availability, often used in consensus algorithms like Paxos and Raft.
